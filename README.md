# n8n-automation-workflows

This repository contains a collection of my experimental automation workflows built with n8n, demonstrating practical applications of automation and AI integration in business processes.

## Some of my Workflows

### 1. [Bewerbungsfilter (Application Filter)](./Gmail_label_filtering/README.md)
A sophisticated email filtering system for job applications with three different approaches:

- **Keyword Version**: Simple but rigid filtering based on subject keywords like "Bewerbung" and "Job"
- **AI Version**: Uses Gemini API for intelligent classification with balanced cost-efficiency
- **AI Tools Version**: Advanced AI agent orchestration for maximum flexibility

Key features:
- Automated Gmail integration
- Smart classification of incoming emails
- Cost-effective AI implementation

## Getting Started

To use these workflows:

1. Create a qorkflow in n8n portal
2. Import the desired JSON workflow file
3. Configure your credentials for:
   - Gmail (for email workflows)
   - Google Docs (for newsletter workflow)
   - Gemini API (for AI features)
4. Customize the workflow parameters as needed

## Notes

- These workflows are experimental and may need adjustments for your specific use case
- API costs should be considered when implementing AI-based solutions
- Regular monitoring is recommended for optimal performance
